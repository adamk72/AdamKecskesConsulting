# Case Studies of Complex Changes with Exponential Impact

In my discussion around simple changes (here: https://kecskes.net/k/simpleCases), I went over how small changes can have a dispropotionate impact on a business. Simple changes are limited however; generally speaking, small changes will only help incrementally. If your organization seeks vast changes to occur, then things become logically more complex.

The key to implmenting complex changes is understanding the end goal and minimizing the complexity of implementation where possible -- or -- understanding the details so that the implemntation has a dramatic, outsized, even exponential impact, exceeding the desired final goal (without going over scheudle or budget).

# Improving the Custom Enterprise User Experienece and Database Performance

### Setup

When I took on this project, the situation was that of a non-normalized, un-index database, a slow admiinstrative set of webpages, and a convoluted (obviously untested) user experience for the internal users of the system. On top of this, we had to make the changes incrementally, and we had to be extermely careful, as the client side could not be changed, only the administrative and enterprise systems. Everything had to be backwards compatible as a result.

### The Result

Before going into details, I want to share the results, because they were outsized to what we had done. The project took about 6 months, and because of the way tasks were arranged and selected, we saw an accerlarting return on our efforts as time passed; that is, things got a lot easier and we were seeing problems get solved more rapidly (part of that was due to the fact that the most complex issues were solved first, but solving those issues made future tasks less complex to fix).

We fixed the problems: The database ran twice as fast, producing a better peforming client as a result; it took content managers a fraction of the time to get there work done, eliminating many interns that were doing trivial work. The user experience was greatly improved --- TBD
