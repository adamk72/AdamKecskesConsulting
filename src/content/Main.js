                <p>
                  I'm a troubleshooter; instead of putting up with the status
                  quo, I'm always asking, 'What improvements can we make to make
                  our efforts a little easier?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also maintain a customer-centric worldview. The question I
                  ask myself is, "Which solutions benefit the most of us, and
                  still respect all of us?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  As such, I've moved up to Director and VP positions at various
                  companies because that is where I can provide the greatest
                  level of service. However, I'm not afraid to dig into code,
                  databases, or documentation when necessary. Often times it's
                  looking into the details that reveal issues &mdash; and
                  solutions &mdash; which will best impact the entire
                  organization.

                  I've worked for 3 large cap companies and 3 startup companies
                  <br />
                  all at various stages of maturity,&nbsp;&nbsp;giving me a
                  broad scope

                  of business opportunites to learn from.

                <p>
                  The best teams Iâ€™ve lead or worked for have been the ones
                  where we had mutual respect for one another and engaged in our
                  work with transparency and humility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In teams that I manage, I rely heavily on the expertise and
                  fact-oriented opinions of each person to make better overall
                  decisions. I distinctly enjoy learning about the innovative
                  solutions that my teams come up with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And when it comes to leadership, I stick to principles that
                  respect each person; you don't know why they did X, Y, or Z
                  unless you ask them. Principles such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Transparency &amp; Honesty</li>
                    <li>Safety both in the environment and in failure</li>
                    <li>
                      Recognize leadership and provide opportunities for
                      improvement
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </SimpleCard>
            </Grid.Column>
          </Grid.Row>
        </Grid>
      </Container>
    </Segment>
