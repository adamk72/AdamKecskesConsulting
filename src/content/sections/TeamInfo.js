    <p>
      The best teams Iâ€™ve lead or worked for have been the ones where we had
      mutual respect for one another and engaged in our work with transparency
      and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      In teams that I manage, I rely heavily on the expertise and fact-oriented
      opinions of each person to make better overall decisions. I distinctly
      enjoy learning about the innovative solutions that my teams come up with.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when it comes to leadership, I stick to principles that respect each
      person; you don't know why they did X, Y, or Z unless you ask them.
      Principles such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparency &amp; Honesty</li>
      <li>Safety both in the environment and in failure</li>
      <li>Recognize leadership and provide opportunities for improvement</li>
    </ul>
