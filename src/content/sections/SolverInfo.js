    <p>
      I'm a troubleshooter; instead of putting up with the status quo, I'm
      always asking, 'What improvements can we make to make our efforts a little
      easier?
    </p>
    <p>
      I also maintain a customer-centric worldview. The question I ask myself
      is, "Which solutions benefit the most of us, and still respect all of us?"
    </p>

      As such, I've moved up to Director and VP positions at various companies
      because that is where I can provide the greatest level of service.
      However, I'm not afraid to dig into code, databases, or documentation when
      necessary. Often times it's looking into the details that reveal issues
      &mdash; and solutions &mdash; which will best impact the entire
      organization.
