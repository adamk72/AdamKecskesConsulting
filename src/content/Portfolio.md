# Planned Projects

---

- **Professional Progress Website**
  - The site you're looking it, done in ReactJS.
- **Personal Activity Tracker for FitBit**
  - A simple app where a user inputs a list of activites to be tracked; at the start of each activity, the user can quickly start the timer. The goal is for the user to be more conscious of where time in their day is spent.
- **State of Mind Tracker for FitBit**
  - Similar to the tracker, but the user tracks their choices and action from a more philosophical point of view, following the prececpts of _Monk, Marshallow, or Monster_.
- **Esoteric Word Website**
  - As a bit of word nerd and public speaking trainer, I want to promote words that are not as well used, but I think would really add flavor to our conversations and definitely take up a professional speakera anoter notch.
