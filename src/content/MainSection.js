              <p>
                I'm a troubleshooter; instead of putting up with the status quo,
                I'm always asking, 'What improvements can we make to make our
                efforts a little easier?
              </p>
              <p>
                I also maintain a customer-centric worldview. The question I ask
                myself is, "Which solutions benefit the most of us, and still
                respect all of us?"
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, I've moved up to Director and VP positions at various
                companies because that is where I can provide the greatest level
                of service. However, I'm not afraid to dig into code, databases,
                or documentation when necessary. Often times it's looking into
                the details that reveal issues &mdash; and solutions &mdash;
                which will best impact the entire organization.

              <p>
                The best teams Iâ€™ve lead or worked for have been the ones where
                we had mutual respect for one another and engaged in our work
                with transparency and humility.
              </p>
              <p>
                In teams that I manage, I rely heavily on the expertise and
                fact-oriented opinions of each person to make better overall
                decisions. I distinctly enjoy learning about the innovative
                solutions that my teams come up with.
              </p>
              <p>
                And when it comes to leadership, I stick to principles that
                respect each person; you don't know why they did X, Y, or Z
                unless you ask them. Principles such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Transparency &amp; Honesty</li>
                <li>Safety both in the environment and in failure</li>
                <li>
                  Recognize leadership and provide opportunities for improvement
                </li>
              </ul>
            </SimpleCard>
          </Col>
        </Row>
      </Container>
    </Container>
  );
