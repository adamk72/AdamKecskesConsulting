# Philosophy of Optimization

I'm always amazed at how often I have conversations with people at various levels of business that leave me wondering, "How does anyone get any work done?"

But we all know the answer: A company doesn't have to be "efficient" to be profitable, it just needs to be _effective_. Get enough people pointed in somewhat the same direction and presto, you have a viable and possibly even profitable company.

Being _effective_ is, however, doubly amplified if a company happens to also be _efficient_. Think of effectiveness as the short term solution, i.e., "Get 'er done," while efficiency is more about long term thinking. Working towards efficiency helps across all levels of development for a company, aiding as much in startup mode as in growth mode. If you work towards being efficient, you are simultaneously working towards effectiveness.

At the time I write this, Covid19 is front of mind in most people's lives, business owners and employees alike. It is in times like these were one might wonder if something can be done to make the company a little more efficient, a little leaner. At the very least, lean enough to survive until we start to see a recovery. Ideally, the company will be so efficient that it will perform even better after broader economic growth.

The answer is yes, you can. And despite the struggles that are happening, this is as good a time as any to get started on looking at where your organization can be a bit more effective. Learn these skills and make these process improvements now... and next time there's a crisis you will be that much further ahead.

## The 5 Questions

If you're a small to medium-sized company, there are few questions you should ask about your company. Optimization starts very simply. Optimization is not always about tweaking code and revamping tired processes; oftentimes it's simply about helping people be more effective at their work.

1. Do you have an internal communications system that is _not_ email?
2. Do _all_ meetings start with a _succinct_ agenda?
3. Are spreadsheets being used _only_ for pure data analysis and not as glorified to-dos list or project dashboards?
4. Do you have a single source of "truth" and is it regularly maintained and shared by the _entire_ company?
5. Do you maintain a project tracking system?

The answer to all these questions should be a yes, and you should also understand how a positive answer to these questions puts you far beyond many companies out there in terms of effectiveness. You may still need help, but at least your organization is on the right track.

By answering these questions with an efficiency mindset, you go from being effective (assuming you were to being with) to being more productive, because you are more efficient.

These questions are purposely light-weight because 1) it's more efficient to ask simple questions and 2) because optimization starts with the most simple of processes and procedures -- those things we often overlook.
