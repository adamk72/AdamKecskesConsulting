# The Spreadsheet

## A simple case study in spreadsheet improvements

I’ve fixed more businesses by getting them off spreadsheets rather than continuing to use them for things like to-do lists and ad-hoc databases. Spreadsheets are useful tools if used what they are intended for, which is mainly analytics of relatively small amounts of data. They are certainly no substitute for big data computing algorithms.

In one organization, I worked on a team of five technical specialist who did weekly reporting and analysis. I was the last person to join the group, but I had seen their process in full and understood how it worked, and it was slow.

It took one person a full working day to complete the import of data, do the analysis, and present the report. At that time, it was 8 x 4 = 32 hours of work to get the four reports done, and this amount of time was growing linearly with the increase in data.

Before I came into the group, I was already exploring ways of improving the system without having too much of an impact on the rest of the organization (or the budget). The answer was in automating more of the spreadsheet which at this point was mostly manual manipulation of the data.

Though a bit of after-hours work, I added a number of macros and formulas to the spreadsheet to heavily change its behavior. Gone where a lot of the column and row manipulation which took up most of the time and instead it was just a simple matter of importing the data and pressing some buttons.

The end result was a dramatic improvement in performance. If I had joined the group and not made the changes, it would have been 8 x 5 = 40 hours of person-hours to get the work down each week. With my changes, the analysis dropped to under half an hour: .5 x 5= 2.5 hours of work, a 68% improvement in performance. And more to the point, the time to do these reports wasn’t going to keep growing; the analysis time was fixed to under half an hour, limit more by the fact that spreadsheets can only handle so much data before bogging down and we had yet to come near that number.

Despite the reputation spreadsheets have for being “automated” (at least in terms of graphs and other visual delights), an organization that doesn’t take the time to review processes that take a very long time might be caught in a similar trap to the one my company was stuck when I joined the group.
