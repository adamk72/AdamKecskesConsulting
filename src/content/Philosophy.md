# Philosophy of Optimization

## Preamble

I'm always amazed at how often I have conversations with people at various levels of business that leave me wondering, "How does anyone get any work done?"

But we all know the answer: A company doesn't have have to be "efficient" in order to be profitable, it just needs to be _effective_. Get enough people pointed in somewhat the same direction and presto, you have a viable and possible even profitable company.

Ideas of efficiency and optimization have little to do with running and business and making money -- sometimes.

At the time I write this, Covid19 is front of mind in most people's lives, business owners and employees alike. It's times like these were one might wonder if something can be done to make the company a little more effecient, a little more lean. At the very least, lean enough to survive until we start to see a recovery.

The answer is yes, you can. And despite the struggles that are happening, this is as good a time as any to get started on looking at where your organization can be a bit more effective. Learn these skills and make these process improvements now... and next time there's a crisis you will be that much further ahead.

## The 5 Questions

If you're a small to medium sized company, there are few questions you should ask about your company. Optimization starts very simply. Optimization is not always about tweaking code and revamping tired processes; oftentimes it's simply about helping people be more effective at their work.

1. Do you have an internal communications system that is _not_ email?
2. Do _all_ meetings start with a _succinct_ agenda?
3. Are spreadsheets being used _only_ for pure data analysis and not as glorfied to-dos list or project dashboards?
4. Do you have a single source of "truth" and is it reguarly maintained and shared by the _entire_ company?
5. Do you maintain a project tracking system?

The answer to all these questions should be a yes, and you should also understand how a positive answer to these questions puts you far beyond many companies out there in terms of effeciveness. You may still need help, but at least your organization is on the right track.

## States of Organizational Optimization

A company is alway in one of three states: **Chaotic**, **Steady**, or **Refractory**. Knowing which state your organization is in will help guide you with tactical and strategic decisions alike.

Steady state is the ideal state to be in; however, because life happens to us all, it cannot be sustained indefinitely. Knowing that inevitablely an organization will leave the steady state, business owners and managers can plan for that eventuality so that they can return the company back to steady state as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The other two states are transitory -- and ideally should be as short lived as possible; what constitutes "short" depends on the nature of the company, budget, and employee engagement.

My job is to help companies recognize what state they are in and help them make the necessary transitions. Even a steady state organization needs help and guidance so if managment wants to sustain that state for as long as possible. If you're interested in knowing more, feel free to reach out to me.
